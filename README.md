# Susan's Javascript Quiz

For the Module 4 Challenge, I created a JavaScript Quiz that tests a user's knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.

Due to a difficult month at work, I could not focus nor dedicate the time needed to complete this challenge. 

I will resubmit this properly at a later date because this is a fun challenge that I do want to figure out!

Thank you for grading this incomplete attempt.
